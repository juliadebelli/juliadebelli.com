# Fixing football court in real life
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Here I'll document and share the process of temporarily fixing the sports court I play futsal / arena soccer</p>

<img src="assets/aurora-cage.jpg" style="border-radius: 1em;" class="w-25" alt="picture of a mixed sports court without the grill cage at ground level">
<br><br>
<p>
City hall recently removed the metal cage on the sides of the court because they were all rusty and with huge holes where balls would easily (and accidentally) get shot into. An unfortunate bullseye.</p><br>
<img src="assets/aurora-workers.jpg" style="border-radius: 1em;" class="w-25"><br><br>
<p>Problem is, public power interveened and took it off, which is fine, but god only knows when they'll be installing new ones. Latin America in a nutshell.
<br><br>
I've joined the all-female futsal team <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aurorafcrecife/" target="_blank">Aurora FC</a> in mid-2021, ever since the pandemic slowed down and collective sports were safe (and allowed) to be played in public again.<br><br></p>

<p>We play on this public court at Aurora Street, a riverside linear park. The edge of the sidewalk has this barrier-thing to keep people from falling off the river, but it happens to be damaged exactly parallel to half-way line, up until the south goal line. On high tide days, the ball will most likely be lost forever if accidentally kicked outside, for there's a pipe standing right below that pumps the river water and sucks in all debris floating next to it.
<br><br>
Now that the grill is removed, balls have an even higher chance of scoring this cursed goal. Until city hall comes back on <span class="italico">undefined</span> to re-do the metal work, it's up to us to try and act in reducing damage.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 1.6em;">I've come to see it as a design challenge, to try and build a temporary solution for minimizing balls lost while protection is missing</span>
<br><br>
<br><br>
My first prototype was tying both goal nets on the metal posts using insulation tape. It worked but only that time, as I had to take it off once we were done. Besides bureaucrausts, we also have to deal with the ever-lingering possibility that someone might take something left unattended in a public spot, specially overnight and, in our case, over a week. A reminder that we hail from a country where impoverished men regularly take their own lives accidently while trying to steal copper wires from public electric infrastructure, in order to sell it in the black market if they happen to be alive after the ordeal.
<br><br>
The materials used should be cheap enough nobody will take interest in stealing them. That's the first constraint.
<br><br>
It also can't be something that requires power tools to be installed, as there's no power outlet easily accessible in the surroundings of the court.
<br><br>
I'll be keeping this entry updated with every new <span class="italico"><a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeitinho">gambiarra</a></span> I try, and whether it worked or not.<br><br>
It's going to be an honour to have it removed by city hall, and I trust they'll only do this once the court is ready for re-modelling - and my job will be done.
<br><br>
