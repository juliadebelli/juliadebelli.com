<h1 id="design-and-open-source">Design and Open-Source</h1>
<p>Open source (or open code) are software whose codebase is open to the public, and kept by institutions or individuals. That implies all open source projects have their <em>recipe</em> exposed in plain sight for anyone to access, fork and mess around with, unlike software-as-a-service (such as Adobe Cloud) or private code that belongs to companies, banks and governments.</p>
<p>Some open source projects accept <em>pull requests</em>, which is the act of <em>downloading</em> the code of a project, building on top of it - either by adding new features, rewriting snippets or fixing bugs - and submitting those contritbutions to the mantainers of that project, which in turn will check your work and decide whether or not they&#39;ll accept your request to collaborate, or not.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge community of open source projects and contributors that&#39;s almost as big as the internet itself, and all of this is possible thanks to the strong culture of collaborating that exists in the developer community ever since it became a thing. Developers will spend hours on a row reading, writing and teaching code for free, which is a rare sight in a world that&#39;s getting more transactional by the hour.</p>
<p>Most programmers I know have learned a great deal from strangers on the internet. Eventually their chance to teach and give back comes, but even the most senior developer will still ask for help sometime.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>There are companies, both private and third-sector, that employ developers and designers to work professionally in open-source projects. Some examples are Mozilla, Rocket Chat and DuckuckGo.</p>
<p>Some companies even start as open source projects, and then start operating as SaaS. Ghost, Elastic and Vercel are some of the services that were once open source.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>There goes a list of open source software, what they do, and what private software they can be used in the stead:</p>
<p>Krita, digital painting and drawing (Photoshop)</p>
<p>Gimp, image editing and digital painting (Photoshop)</p>
<p>Inkscape, vector-based image editing (Illustrator)</p>
<p>Firefox, the famous</p>
<p>Thunderbird, emails (Outlook)</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo, search engine (Google)</p>
<p>Chromium, the open source to Google Chrome</p>
<p>Minetest (Minecraft)</p>
<h2 id="contributing-why-and-how">Contributing: why and how</h2>
<p>The same way programmers tinker with open source code for their own learning and self-improvement, designers might use open source to practice drawing assets and screens. Some projects desperately need a designer&#39;s touch! ðŸ¥²</p>
<h2 id="credit-and-ceremonies">Credit and ceremonies</h2>
<p>The fluidity in open source allows for a project to be duplicated, line by line, and later hosted somewhere else to be marketed as a proprietary software product or service. That&#39;s not a rare sight and I&#39;ve seen a dozen startups that began their companies this way.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a good practice to give credit when using any code written by somebody else, except if they explicitly state there&#39;s no need to.</p>
