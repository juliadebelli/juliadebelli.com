<h1 id="fixing-football-court-in-real-life">Fixing football court in real life</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

<p>Here I&#39;ll document and share the process of temporarily fixing the sports court I play futsal / arena soccer</p></p>
<img src="assets/aurora-cage.jpg" style="border-radius: 1em;" class="w-25" alt="picture of a mixed sports court without the grill cage at ground level">
<br><br>
<p>
City hall recently removed the metal cage on the sides of the court because they were all rusty and with huge holes where balls would easily (and accidentally) get shot into. An unfortunate bullseye.</p><br>
<img src="assets/aurora-workers.jpg" style="border-radius: 1em;" class="w-25"><br><br>
<p>Problem is, government intervened and took it off, which is fine, but god only knows when they'll be installing new ones. Latin America in a nutshell.
<br><br>
I've joined the all-female futsal league <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aurorafcrecife/" target="_blank">Aurora FC</a> in mid-2021, ever since the pandemic slowed down and collective sports were safe (and allowed) to be played in public again. It's free for all and we play every monday from 7p to 10pm.<br><br></p>

<p>Matches are played at this public court on Aurora Street, part of a riverside linear park lying on the edge of downtown Recife. To the north stands a brand-new government-built skatepark. Southwards, a rusty 70s playground whereby a crowd of older gentlemen gather every night to play dominoes. Most court regulars though, are students from nearby schools during the day, and once the sun is down it's mostly working-class youth from lower-income areas surrounding the sparsely-packed city center.
<br><br>
The edge of the sidewalk has a waist-high fence to keep people from falling off the river, but part of the structure fell off exactly parallel to the half-way line, up until the south goal line. On high tide days, balls will most likely be lost forever if accidentally kicked to that direction. When the water level is low, we're able jump down and get the ball back.
<br><br>
Now that the court fence is also missing, balls have an even higher chance of crossing two inexistent walls and scoring this cursed goal. Until city hall comes back on <span class="italico">undefined</span> to re-do the metal work, it's up to court comers to set up a temporary fix.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 1.6em;">I've come to see it as a design challenge, to try and build a solution for minimizing balls lost while protection is missing</span>
<br><br>
Materials used should be cheap enough nobody will take interest in stealing them.
<br><br>
It cannot be something that requires any power tools to be installed, as there's no power outlet easily accessible nearby.
<br><br>

<p>My first prototype was tying 2 goal nets on the metal posts using insulation tape, like a makeshift fence. It worked but only that time, as I had to take it off once we were done. Besides bureaucrausts, we also have to deal with the ever-lingering possibility that someone might take something left unattended in a public spot.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>02/10/2023</h3>
<p>
The following week, I brought some generic string yard to tie the nets to the metal posts. Did a better job than insulation tape.<br>
Also went and did some rough estimations of size by tying string around the whole - unsuccessful.<br><br>
Will try again next week.

I'll be keeping this entry updated with every new <span class="italico"><a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeitinho">gambiarra</a></span> I try, and whether it worked or not.<br><br>
It's going to be an honour to have it removed by city hall, and I trust they'll only do this once the court is ready for re-modelling - and my job will be done.
