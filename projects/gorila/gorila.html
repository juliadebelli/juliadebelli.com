            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
            Gorila is an investment management app marketed to a market-savy, Brazilian userbase. It first came to be
            when a group of fund managers decided to make into a web-app the tools they had built internally
            and used to fetch and calculate data in their clients' portfolio.<br><br>
            Investors usually have diverse types of assets purchased all over the place, so Gorila centralizes all portfolios and shows the user both general overview
            of all assets, to different classes and expanded views of overtime variation of prices.
            <br><br>
            The platform consisted of a React web-app for desktop users, and a mobile React-native app that came later but had fewer features
            than its counterpart. Most of the work I had done so far had been adapting desktop-made views to mobile, until they were on par.
            <br><br>
            Live Market Data was the first feature ever to be commissioned exclusively for the mobile app. It was also the first novel feature
            I was leading production, as I got the opportunity to draw it from wireframe to Zeplin, also adding it to the existing design system
            and documentation.

          <h3>Research Phase</h3></p>
          <h6>User Research</h6>
          <p>
            I approached finance professionals, in-person and on Whatsapp (n≈20) and gathered a list of 5 apps they used to check the price 
            of stocks during trading hours.<br><br></p>
            <h6>They were</h6>
            <p>TradeMap (main competition)<br>
              Investing.com<br>
              Bloomberg<br>
              Yahoo Finance<br>
              Native Stocks Apps (Google, iOS)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
            <p>We analyzed the above-mentioned services to identify what's familiar to the userbase, and what could be opportunities to deliver an improved experience.

            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ideation and Design</h3>
            <h6>Use cases</h6>
            <p>Based on our research, we found 2 main user flows that the feature should appeal to
              <br>
              <br>
            <span class="negrito">Cabin:</span> User will pick a couple, but no more than a dozen favorite stocks to focus their attention<br>
            <span class="negrito">Grandstand:</span> User will watch multiple stocks in a zoom-out analysis, like watching all horses race while betting on none <br>
            </p>
           <br>
            <h6>Design Principles</h6>
            <p>
            Based on our talks with long-time and novice stocks app users, we established the following design principles:
            <br><br>
            <span class="negrito">Familiarity:</span> Users should be able to navigate information in a similar manner to existing tools;<br>
            <span class="negrito">Neatness:</span> Numbers and graphs shouldn't clouder the screen<br>
            <span class="negrito">Personalization:</span> Users should have the ability to customize their stock viewer to suit their preferences.<br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <h6>Information Architecture and Wireframes</h6>
          <p>We created wireframes and an information architecture that included:
          </p>

          Dashboard: An overview of the user's portfolio with key metrics like total value, gains/losses, and a pie chart displaying the portfolio composition.

          Stock Details: A dedicated page for each stock in the portfolio with real-time data, historical charts, and news.

          Watchlist: A section for users to track stocks they are interested in but haven't invested in yet.

          Prototyping
          We created interactive prototypes to validate the user flow and gather feedback from potential users.

          Testing and Iteration
          Usability Testing
          We conducted usability testing with a diverse group of users to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Key findings included:

        </div>

        Users appreciated the intuitive dashboard with clear visualizations.
        Some novice users felt overwhelmed by the amount of data, so we simplified the presentation.
        Experienced traders wanted advanced charting and analysis tools, which we integrated.
        Iterations
        Based on user feedback, we made several iterations to the design, including:

        Simplifying the initial dashboard view for novice users.
        Adding tooltips and explanations for complex data points.
        Enhancing the charting capabilities with technical analysis tools for advanced users.
        Final Design
        Visual Design
        The final design incorporated the app's existing aesthetic while introducing a color-coded system for stock performance and intuitive icons for actions.

        Features
        Key features of the final design included:

        Customizable Dashboard: Users could select the metrics and stocks displayed on their dashboard.
        Recommendations: The app offered stock recommendations and insights based on user preferences.
        Advanced Charting: Experienced users had access to advanced charting and technical analysis tools.
        Conclusion
        The Stocks Viewer feature in the Investments App is a user-centered solution that caters to a diverse user base, from novice investors to experienced traders. By offering real-time data, customization, and insights, the feature enhances the user experience and empowers users to make informed investment decisions. Future iterations may include integrating AI for more personalized recommendations and expanding to other investment asset classes.
