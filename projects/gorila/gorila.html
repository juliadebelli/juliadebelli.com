            <p>
            Gorila is an investment management app marketed to a market-savvy, Brazilian userbase. It first came to be
            when a group of fund managers decided to make into a web-app the tools they had built internally
            and used to fetch and calculate data in their clients' portfolio.<br><br>
            Investors usually have diverse types of assets purchased all over the place, so Gorila centralizes all portfolios and shows the user both general overview
            of all assets, to different classes and expanded views of overtime variation of prices. The app was free for all but also offered premium individual 
            membership and B2B accounts for managers of many accounts. 
            <br><br>
            The platform consisted of a React web-app for desktop users, and a mobile React-native app that came later but had fewer features
            than its counterpart. Most of the work I had done so far had been adapting desktop-made views to mobile, until they were on par.
            <br><br>
            Live Market Data was the first feature ever to be commissioned exclusively for the mobile app. It was also the first novel feature
            I was leading production, as there was no prior desktop feature to reference. So I got the opportunity to draw it from wireframe to final hand-off.

          <h3>Research Phase</h3></p>
          <h6>User Research</h6>
          <p>
            I approached finance professionals, in-person and on Whatsapp (n≈20) and gathered a list of 5 apps they used to check the price 
            of stocks during trading hours.<br><br></p>
            <h6>They were</h6>

            <h3>Ideation and Design</h3><br>
            <h6>Use cases</h6>
            <p>Based on our research, we found 2 main user flows that the feature should appeal to
              <br>
              <br>
            <span class="negrito">Cabin:</span> User will pick a couple, but no more than a dozen favorite stocks to focus their attention<br>
            <span class="negrito">Grandstand:</span> User will watch multiple stocks in a zoom-out analysis, like watching all horses race while betting on none <br>
            </p>
           <br>
            <h6>Design Principles</h6>
            <p>
            Based on our talks with long-time and novice stocks app users, we established the following design principles:
            <br><br>
            <span class="negrito">Familiarity:</span> Users should be able to navigate information in a similar manner to existing third-party tools;<br>
            <span class="negrito">Neatness:</span> Numbers and graphs shouldn't be messy or clouder the screen. Clarity is a must;<br>
            <span class="negrito">Personalization:</span> Users should have total control over what stocks they wish to view.
            <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Before digital interfaces, stock tickets and their prices would be manually updated by a human, whose back stood against a wall filled with several columns and lines 
            of all purchasable assets at that particular exchange. Investors would crowd up around the wall in order to check-in first hand on the latest variation.<br>
          </p>
          <img src="assets/nyse.png" class="w-100">
          <br><br>
          <p>
            The vintage, letterboards stock tickets ended up becoming tables on the very first digital monitors, eventually turning into 
            a single, scrollable column of tickets on our smartphones.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h6>Main view</h6>
          <p>All apps we researched as reference presented stocks in this fashion. Some would do two-a-line on bigger desktop screens.
            One-line, full width cells achieve better visibility. 

            Cells should contain a bar to their left referencing the color of the asset class they belong (the feature also included currency, crypto, funds and American Stocks).<br>
            
            <br>
            The 4 letters, 1 number code (ITSA4, MGLU3, PETR3) in bold letters, as the title of each cell. To their right, the price of the ticket stands opposite 
            to its name on the same line, and below it the price variation percentage along with market-default green and red ▲▼ for ups and downs;
            <br><br>
            A search button and input were added to filter stocks by their code or company name;
            <br><br>
            Long-pressing stock tickets alow them to be removed from main viewing;
            <br><br>
            A LIVE button was added as a premium feature. Free users would get the latest hour trades, to be updated every hour. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h6>Stock Details</h6> 
          <p>Tapping a stock ticket redirects to an individual view of the stock, containing its historical variation and other details.</p>
          <br>
          <h6>Prototyping</h6>
          <p>We created interactive Sketch prototypes to validate the user flow and gather feedback from potential users.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <h3>Feedback and Iteration</h3>
          <p>Based on users' journey in our Sketch Mirror app, we made several iterations to the design, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>Using a ➕ sign instead of 🔎 for researching stocks;</li>

          <li>Adding stocks purchased by user as default;
          </li>
          <li>Sliding cells to the right to favorite/unfavorite and see details (instead of long-press)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Hand-off to production</h3><br>
          <p>The final design was a clean, one-liner stock viewer following Gorila's material design-based aesthetic.<br>
          <br>
            It was placed as the 5th element on bottom app navigation, along with 4 main, pre-existing features (dashboard, wallet, buy/sell button and advanced tools shortcut)
            for it's supposed to be easily accessible by users.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
          <br>
          <p>By using familiar layouts and interactions along with personalized pre-filled stocks, we delivered a feature that intuitively worked for an informed user-base already
            familiar with the language.

            We were happy to receive many reviews from Gorila users that made the switch and started using our app for their market viewing.
